# Major Project Proposal


## Description
A 2d platformer where the main character has a gun. He has to jump on platforms and has to get rid of his enemies. There will be multiple levels, and each will get more difficult as they go.

## Extra Notes
- Worked on p5play demo's the first few days (started making code later)
- Worked on 2d arrays questions on one day

## Needs to have
- A main character that moves (done)
- A physics engine (using p5play) (done)
- The main character's weapon (done)
- an enemy type (done)
- A level (done)
- Death (done)
- Camera is centered around the main character (done)
- main character has lives/health bar (done)

## Nice to have
- Sprites for the project
- A shop where the main character can upgrade themselves
- everytime the main character gets hit (or any other entity), an animation happens
- if any entity dies, an animation happens
- animations in general
- bosses (big big big maybe)
- health bar for any entity
- fast paced movement
- level design with sprites
- different enemy types
- depending on the enemy, there will be different enemy weapons
- collectibles
