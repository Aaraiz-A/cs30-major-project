- Worked on 2d arrays questions on one day

## Needs to have
- A main character that moves (done)
- A physics engine (using p5play) (done)
- The main character's weapon (done)
- an enemy type (done)
- A level (done)
- Death (done)
- Camera is centered around the main character (done)
- main character has lives/health bar (done)

## Nice to have
- Checkpoints (done)
- Sprites for the project
- A shop where the main character can upgrade themselves
- animations
- bosses (big big big maybe)
- health bar for any entity
- fast paced movement (done)
- level design with sprites
- different enemy types
