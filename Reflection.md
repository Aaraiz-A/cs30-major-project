## Reflection

-I would tell myself to start small. One of the problems with me is that when I start something, I always think of some really great ideas, but I end up not doing them due to a lack of time. Essentially, I would tell myself not to bite off more than I can chew. Also, I would tell myself to keep commenting throughout the project, so that you won't need to do it at the end. 

- I did complete everything in my needs to have list

- I believe that the hardest part about my project would be the shooting mechanics and the enemy spawning. The shooting mechanics took me a while to implement because it involved using trig functions, such as cos or sin. Overall, I think my code is pretty basic. 

- I could not figure out enemy spawn points. I wanted the enemyies to spawn within the area of the checkpoints, and I could not figure that out.
